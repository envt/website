	"greeting": "Emilien Vallot",
	"greeting-subtitle-1": "Software Engineer with",
	"greeting-subtitle-2": "years of professional experience building C++ software and tools on Windows, Linux and macOS.",
	"about-1": "Passionate about developing and automating things. It all started back in 2003.",
	"about-2": "At that time, I was already programming in assembly to make 4 levels of gray drawings on my HP40g calculator, but I wanted to become 3D graphic designer.",
	"about-3": "Unfortunately, it didn't work out and I thought to myself:",
	"about-4": "Maybe I can develop tools for graphic designers?!",
	"about-5": "This explains my background, focused on digital imaging, computer vision and later virtual reality.",
	"about-6": "Since then, I've been developing software and tools in several industries such as film, architecture, videography, robotics or even professional audio.",
	"about-7": "I'm always looking for new challenges and things to learn.",
	"about-8": "When I'm not coding, I also enjoy reading, going to the movies, drawing, juggling and photography!",
	"career-1": "All these years allowed me to gather a wide range of skills.",
	"career-2": "My first experience at TechViz during which my knowledge in C, C ++, CPU, GPU and 3D optimization in general (OpenGL, GLSH, DirectX, HLSL, linear algebra, ..) greatly improved. Likewise in other areas such as TCP / UDP networking, hardware device integration, third party assembly code analysis (oops!), CPU / GPU bottleneck detection + optimization, very instructive! In a team of about ten people, excellent first experience.",
	"career-3": "I left for a dream job at SolidAnim. Working closely with graphics designers, helping them getting their job done! I strengthened my C++, Qt5, linear algebra, networking and multi-threading skills. An extraordinary experience that allowed me to discover film sets, and also because the R&D team was free to make technical choices as long as the results were there, I really enjoyed working here.",
	"career-4": "Their move to Bordeaux brought me to L-Acoustics. With passionate people, always up to date on a technical level. Here I was able to update my C++17, CMake, Qt, networking, Jenkins and build systems knowledge, I was also able to bring my 3D expertise for the visualization of acoustic simulations. Great opportunity to work in this area.",
	"career-5": "After a few years, a stint at Abvent and the opportunity to return to the world of 3D. Again, the R&D team was free to make technical choices so we had full controll of the development process (C++17, CMake, Metal, OpenGL, CI, ...). Working with state of the art real-time GPU rendering pipelines was something I really appreciated.",
	"career-6": "And here we are, currently at Fuzzy Logic Robotics a dynamic startup, working on Fuzzy Studio, looking forward to my next challenges!",
